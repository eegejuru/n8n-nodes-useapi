# n8n-nodes-useapi

This n8n community node enables seamless integration of **[useapi.net](http://useapi.net) in your [n8n](https://n8n.io) workflows**.

Implementing in this nodes the following services, via the useapi.net API:
- Midjourney
- Runway
- MiniMax
- Pika (not started yet)
- Riffusion (not started yet)
- Mureka (not started yet)
- PixVerse (not started yet)
- InsightFaceSwap (not started yet)


## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

## More information

You need to set up and configure the Midjourney, Mureka, Runway, InsightFaceSwap, Pika or PixVerse as well as subscribe to useapi.net service before you can start using this experimental API. 

I am not affiliated in any way with useapi.net. Drop me a note if you have any questions. I will try to help and add new features as soon as possible.
